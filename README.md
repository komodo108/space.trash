# Space.Trash
A Programming Puzzle GameÂ· Final Project for CS4303.

### Work In Progress
Getting python to work within Java using [Jython](https://www.jython.org/).
Consider Java program as J, and python program as P, so far we can:
* J calls P function which calls J function
    * Calling an instance of a Java class from within Python
* J calls P function
    * Can call pure python functions from within Java
* Can now convert between Python and Java objects
    * Have class P in Java, instance of P in python and then get that instance in Java

### Story
You are working in a bot factory & you come across an unusual bot which you can't work on.
You are fired from your job. Later, you find some trashed bots including the unusual bot in the trash.

They want you to help them return to their home. You go from planet to planet, programming the
the trashed bots to help you acquire the resources needed to progress.

### Features (ALL WIP)
* Integration with Python to program with
* Built-in code editor with special features (e.g. non-editable sections)
* Initial tutorial levels + tutorials throughout
* Challenging animals with AI
* Many levels where all the bots features will need to be used

### Python Integration
Using [Jython](https://www.jython.org/)...
